						Hey everyone! First and foremost, thanks for reading. I'm not really sure how long I'll keep this up for, but it's been something I've been meaning to work on for a while, so here's me taking a crack at it.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						It's been a busy few months. Quick recap: Thailand for a month to kick off the new year (which was spent in Chiang Mai), great people, great times, full moon party a few weeks later.
						On my way back to America, stopped in Tokyo for three days to discover that Japanese is my favorite cuisine (thanks Hide).
						Fast-forward a few months, did the whole housing hunt in hopes of moving into San Francisco and really lucked out with a great place. Met some great people along the way.
						Caught some nasty stomach flu, missed seeing Metro Boomin, recovered from stomach flu, went to Alamere Falls over Memorial Day weekend which brings us here. Twas the night before the NBA Playoffs, ready to really kick off summer.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						I hope to bring some variety to these talking different topics from tech to music, and perhaps the occasional recap of some things I've been doing. Be sure to keep and eye out!
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>	
						I'm gonna keep this one short and sweet, but look out for more coming in the future!
					  	I hope you enjoy reading these posts half as much as I enjoy making them for you, because I'm having a ball (Drake reference, ICYMI).

	// 				<p>In light of recent events, I can no longer remain silent. My belief in this nation's ability to help tackle the most daunting but important challenge our species has ever faced just vanished overnight. Rapid climate change is a real thing. It has long been time for all of us to take action, but that doesn't mean it's too late for those of us who haven't taken action yet, to take action.</p>
	// 				<p>We are on the brink of having caused irreparable damage to our planet, and our window is closing. The problem is getting worse, and we as a whole are not acting fast enough. The timetable has gone from a few centuries out, to a few decades out, and if this trend continues, it could turn into a few years out. It's time to <b>wake up</b>.</p>
	// 				<p>Join me as I educate myself and attempt to educate others on this topic. Stop by often for new subject matter, and share it with the world. This is a problem greater than a people, or a nation. It doesn't matter your race, gender, ethnicity, or social status. The one common thing everyone living on this planet can say is that this planet is <i><b>our</b></i> home and the time to act is now. </p>
	// 				<p>If you're already here and made it this far, take a few moments to look at this graphic from the popular webcomic series <a href="https://xkcd.com/"><b>xkcd</b></a>. They do an excellent job of providing the history of global temperature fluctuation, and also putting into perspective its impact along the way. It's a start to understanding rapid climate change, and hopefully, everyone viewing it for the first time can learn a thing or two.</p>
