					<p><b>That's me</b> up there on the right, along with 3/5 of my beautiful family (Missing Craig and Beau).</p>
					<p>Currently I am a software engineer for Supply Chain IT at Cisco Systems in San Jose, CA. Throughout the first year of my career, I have specialized in web development, gaining invaluable experience using Angular 1.x as a front end framework. Although I have primarily focused on front end development, I have been getting my hands dirty with data modeling in SAP HANA and Oracle, and even writing some backend Java.</p>
					<p>Outside of work, I'm an avid sports fan. I watch just about everything, and play just about everything. I definitely play more soccer - or football if you will - than anything, but all thats really important is leading an active lifestyle. On the topic of sports, my fantasy football team isn't doing as well as I'd hope this year, but nonetheless it's one of my favorite hobbies and its a great way to stay in touch with friends accross the country.</p>
					<p>I grew up in Ann Arbor, MI, and in May of 2015, got my B.S. in C.S. from the <a href="http://umich.edu/">University of Michigan</a>. Ann Arbor will always hold a special place in my heart. The people, the food, the culture, the seasons, are all part of who I am today. Moving out to the Bay Area in the fall of 2015 was a big change, but a change that I was ready for, and so far it has been treating me well.</p>
					<p>Stop by me-myself-and-scoot if you're curious as to what I'm up to, if you have any intereset in my two cents, or maybe wanna see what products I've got my eye on. Big plans ahead, but baby steps to get there. <b>Join me!</b>
