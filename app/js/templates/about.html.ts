			<p><b>That's me</b> up there on the right, along with 3/5 of my beautiful family (Missing Craig and Beau).</p>
			<p>I'm currently a software engineer for Supply Chain IT at Cisco Systems in San Jose, CA. Throughout the first year and a half of my career, I have specialized in web development, gaining invaluable experience using Angular 1.x as a front end framework. Although I have primarily focused on front end development, I have been getting my hands dirty with data modeling in SAP HANA and Oracle, and even writing some backend Java.</p>
			<p>Outside of work, I'm an avid sports fan. I watch just about everything, and play just about everything. I definitely play more soccer - or football if you will - than anything, but all thats really important is leading an active lifestyle. I also am a huge fan of fantasy football despite my lack of success over the last few years in my leagues. Nonetheless, it's one of my favorite hobbies and its a great way to stay in touch with friends accross the country.</p>
			<p>I grew up in Ann Arbor, MI, and in May of 2015, got my BS in CS from the <a href="http://umich.edu/"><b>University of Michigan</b></a>. Ann Arbor will always hold a special place in my heart. The people, the food, the culture, and the seasons, are all part of who I am today. Moving out to the Bay Area in the fall of 2015 was a big change, but a change that I was ready for, and so far it has been treating me well.</p>
			<p>Stop by me-myself-and-scoot if you're curious to see what I'm up to, or if you just have any intereset in my two cents. Big plans ahead, but baby steps to get there. <b>Join me!</b>
