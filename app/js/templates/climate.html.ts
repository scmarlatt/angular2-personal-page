					<p>In light of recent events, I can no longer remain silent. My belief in this nation's ability to help tackle the most daunting but important challenge our species has ever faced just vanished overnight. Rapid climate change is a real thing. It has long been time for all of us to take action, but that doesn't mean it's too late for those of us who haven't taken action yet, to take action.</p>
					<p>We are on the brink of having caused irreparable damage to our planet, and our window is closing. The problem is getting worse, and we as a whole are not acting fast enough. The timetable has gone from a few centuries out, to a few decades out, and if this trend continues, it could turn into a few years out. It's time to <b>wake up</b>.</p>
					<p>Join me as I educate myself and attempt to educate others on this topic. Stop by often for new subject matter, and share it with the world. This is a problem greater than a people, or a nation. It doesn't matter your race, gender, ethnicity, or social status. The one common thing everyone living on this planet can say is that this planet is <i><b>our</b></i> home and the time to act is now. </p>
					<p>If you're already here and made it this far, take a few moments to look at this graphic from the popular webcomic series <a href="https://xkcd.com/"><b>xkcd</b></a>. They do an excellent job of providing the history of global temperature fluctuation, and also putting into perspective its impact along the way. It's a start to understanding rapid climate change, and hopefully, everyone viewing it for the first time can learn a thing or two.</p>
